:::note[Post DOTH without Invuln]
- You can use your 30% Mit+Short+Rep for the Buster after DOTH and then just live WB1 with both short mits.
- This makes it so you dont have to rely on needing extra mit to survive the Heel/Cleaves (otherwise you need Reprisal + Feint and one extra mit aside from your normal CDs).
- If you dont trust your co-tank to mit you in Wyrmsbreath 1 you can use your third CD (the one you use in Hallowed 2) on the Wyrmsbreath Buster and you'll live and have it back for Hallowed 2.
:::

:::danger[Niddhog's Vow]
- Melees with defensives should prio vow, just because you are flexing doesnt mean you also cant take the vow, this makes healers life easier and makes it so you dont wipe 15m into the fight because of a DRG exploding!
    - MNK/NIN > SAM/RPR > DRG prio is ideal

### P7 Dragon-king Thordan###

:::tip[DKT Mitigation]
- Make sure to wait until the **SECOND** bleed falls off in Dragon-king transition before you use shields, this includes things like Veil/Shake.
    - (Theres one from Estinien and one when Thordan drops down and does his roleplay)
- Mitigation for DKT doesnt snapshot on the cast for all the hits, if you can, make sure to use it around 70-80% of the castbar so it catches all the hits! This only applies to 10s cooldowns.
- Kerachole **NEEDS** to be used after second trinity to be up for Gigaflare! 
- Soil **NEEDS** to be used after the first trinity to be up for Gigaflare (Soil lasts slightly longer than Kera due to lingering)
