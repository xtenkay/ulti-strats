## What is Astro Just Docs?

Astro Just Docs is a flexible, MDX-based authoring framework that allows you to put the focus on writing documentation, while giving you powerful styling options. It has a number of built in styled components, and is built on Tailwind CSS to be as extensible as possible.

## Getting Started 

### Dependencies

Astro Just Docs is built for Astro, a static site generator. Astro Just Docs requires no additional setup beyond what's normally expected when setting up an Astro website. For more details into how Astro works, check out their [getting started guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). 

### Running Locally

Running Astro Just Docs isnt any different then any other Astro based site, and can be up and running in just a few commands. To get setDefaultResultOrder, clone the repository and run the following commands to install the dependencies and start the development server:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:underlost/astro-just-docs.git
cd astro-just-docs
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Production

Astro Just Docs is a static website and can be hosted just about anywhere. It has also been tested to run on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and AWS S3.

To build a production-ready build of the site to upload somewhere, run: 

```shell
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all the files needed to host the site.

### Configuring 

Astro Just Docs has a number of helpful settings. Refer to the [configuration](/configuration/) section for all options available.

Astro Just Docs is Â© 2024 by [Tyler Rilling](https://underlost.net/). It was originally created with GatsbyJS, and was inspired by [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/), a Jekyll theme. It was rewritten in Astro to take advantage of the speed and flexibility of the framework.
