## Basics

The following is a code block with JavaScript language syntax highlighting:

```javascript title="Javascript"
import React from 'react';
```

## Supports Multiple Languages

Astro Just Docs uses Shiki and Expressive Code for easy code highlighting. Over 100 languages are supported with no additional configuration. Refer to the [Shiki documentation](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md) for a list of supported languages.

## Titles

To add a title to the code block, use the `title` attribute.

```text showLineNumbers=false
javascript title="Javascript"
import React from 'react';
```

```javascript title="Javascript"
import React from 'react';
```

## Line Numbers

By default, the code block will have line numbers. To remove line numbers, use the `showLineNumbers` attribute set to `false`.

```text showLineNumbers=false
javascript showLineNumbers=false
import React from 'react';
```


```javascript title="Javascript" showLineNumbers=false
import React from 'react';
```


## Diff Highlighting

The following is a code block with diff. The `del` attribute is used to highlight the deleted lines and the `add` attribute is used to highlight the added lines.

```text showLineNumbers=false
javascript del={1} add={2}
const data = ['1','2'];
const data = [1,2];
```


```javascript del={1} add={2}
const data = ['1','2'];
const data = [1,2];
```
